corner type 1:
AD From the corner: Two perpendicular cardinals, one diagonal
CA From the diagonal: Two cardinals and one diagonal

corner type 2:
..D From the diagonal: One diagonal and no cardinals
AC. From the corner: two perpendicular cardinals, no diagonals
.A. 

for the diagonal algorithm:
if there is one diagonal, and no cardinals, then there is one corner

otherwises, if there is a cardinal in a direction, check the perpendicular cardinal,
then check the cardinal + perpendicular to see if they are all filled
count 1 for each

for the corner algorithm:
if there is two perpendicular cardinals, there is a corner
